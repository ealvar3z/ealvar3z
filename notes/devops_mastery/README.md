# Five Steps to DevOps Mastery
(there is one more step: observability)

**Caveat**: knowing these at an intermediate level or higher will allow
you to pivot into the rest of them. For example, Mastering git and
Github as a git service provider, will make it easy to pivot to Gitlab,
or Bitbucket. The same logic applies to cloud providers, in this post, I
simply focus on the industry standards (i.e. AWS, Jenkins, Ansible,
Docker, k8s, etc).

Mastering these make the above roadmap a lot more palatable.

## Roadmap

1. Step 1 Revision Control:
  - Practices:
    - Basics of revision control
    - Branching and merging (resolving conflicts)
    - Working w/ remotes
    - Branching Models ([trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com))
    - Branch Policies:
      - Code reviews (PRs, etc)
      - CI integrations
  - Tools:
    - git
    - git service providers:
      - Github
      - Gitlab
      - Bitbucket

1. Step 2 Cloud:
    - AWS

1. Step 3 IaaC:
    - Ansible
    - Terraform

1. Step 4 CI/CD:
    - Jenkins

1. Step 5 Containers:
    - Docker
    - Kubernetes

## Secrets that everyone knows but forgets about

1. Know and master Systems Engineering
    - Linux administration
    - Networking
    - Unix tools

1. Build troubleshooting skills
    - Hardware
    - OS
