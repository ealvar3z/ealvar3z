# Personal Log and Notes

This is my space to jot down any and every stream of thought that comes into my
brain while I am hacking away at the terminal, so that I do not lose the
information while it brews. This lifestyle of jotting down and catching ideas as
they arrive were received by me via the talented, highly opinionated and the 
kindest human being I have come in virtual contact with. His internet handle is 
`rwxrob` and you can catch his [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/rwxrob) just 
about every day.

Shout out to Rob.
